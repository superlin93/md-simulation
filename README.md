This repository contains Matlab code to analyse Molecular Dynamics simulations. 
See the manual on how the code should be used, and the accompanying paper for a thorough 
explanation on how all the properties are calculated. 

When you use the code in academic work please cite the paper:
Analysis of diffusion in solid state electrolytes through MD-simulations, improvement of
the Li-ion conductivity in beta-Li3PS4 as an example; Niek J.J. de Klerk, Eveline van der Maas and Marnix Wagemaker, ACS Applied Energy Materials, (2018), doi: 10.1021/acsaem.8b00457
